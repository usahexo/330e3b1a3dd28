#  The Power of Poseidon: Abuse Victims Float to the Surface

“Poseidon, God of the Sea, have mercy on me!” This invocation was uttered countless times by sailors in peril. The ancient Greeks believed that Poseidon could save them from danger at sea. But for too many abuse victims, Poseidon was more akin to a vengeful god who abandoned them to their ordeals.

It is often said that the ocean is a metaphor for the psyche, and that its depths contain the secrets of our subconscious minds. For centuries, men have ventured onto the high seas in search of adventure and wealth. But for women and children who were victims of abuse, the ocean was a place of fear and dread.

The tides carried their secrets away and left them to suffer in silence. For too many victims, there seemed to be no escape from their tormentors. They were trapped on land or at sea, with no one to help them.

But now, thanks to modern technology, we are learning about the hidden epidemic of abuse that has been going on for centuries. Victims are coming forward to tell their stories and seek justice. And social media is providing a global platform for their voices to be heard.

In recent years, there has been an outpouring of support for abuse victims on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Hashtags like #MeToo and #TimesUp have helped to raise awareness about the issue and provide a safe space for victims to share their stories.

And now there is a new hashtag that is helping to raise awareness about abuse at sea: #PoseidonToo. This hashtag was created by abuse victim Kellyana Constantine in response to the documentary film The Great Harbor which tells the story of three women who were abused by their husbands while sailing around the world.

Kellyana Constantine is a survivor of domestic violence and sexual assault who was raped by her husband during a voyage around the world. In her own words: “I am speaking out not only because I am one voice among many but also because I want those who feel they are living in isolation and fear – either afloat or ashore – to know they are not alone; that there is community waiting for them should they reach out; that healing is possible; that life can go on after horrific trauma if we dare to believe it will….please join me in amplifying this conversation by using #poseidontoo when you post about your experiences or those of loved ones…together we can break through barriers of silence, shame & isolation and begin to heal”

The hashtag #PoseidonToo has already started trending on Twitter, and it has generated a lot of discussion about the issue of abuse at sea. Abuse victims are sharing their stories online using this hashtag, and they are demanding justice from Poseidon-the God of the Sea.
