Rowan Atkinson, the actor best known for his role in the TV series "Mr. Bean", has invented a new slot machine. The machine, which is called "The Bean Machine", is based on the Mr. Bean character and features animated characters from the show.

Atkinson came up with the idea for the machine after visiting a casino in Monaco. He noticed that many of the slot machines were based on popular TV shows and movies, and thought that it would be a good idea to create a machine that was based on his own TV show.

The "Bean Machine" is a five-reel slot machine with 20 paylines. It is available at casinos in the United Kingdom and other countries around the world. In addition to Mr. Bean, other characters from the show appear in the game, including Irma Gobb and Teddy.

The "Bean Machine" has proved to be very popular among casino players. In its first week of release, it generated over £1 million in revenue for casino operators.
