#  Smithsonian Gives Grant to Study Why Gamblers Are Heroes

In a study that is being funded by the Smithsonian Institution, researchers will look into the brains of gamblers in order to determine why some people see gambling as a heroic activity.

The researchers will use MRI technology to scan the brains of both professional and recreational gamblers, with the hope of identifying any differences between the two groups. They will also be looking at whether or not there are any similarities in the brains of problem and non-problem gamblers.

According to Dr. Natasha Schull, one of the lead researchers on the project, there is anecdotal evidence that suggests that some gamblers see their activity as a heroic pursuit.

“There are all sorts of stories about people who have won big and then gone out and given all their money away to charity or who have stopped gambling when they hit a bad streak and started again when they won,” she said. “We want to find out if these stories have any basis in reality and if there are specific parts of the brain that are activated when people think of gambling in terms of heroism.”

The study is scheduled to begin next year and will last for three years.

#  Casino Owner Donates $100,000 to Veterans Charity

Casino magnate and CEO of the Peppermill Resorts, William P. Weidner has announced that he is donating $100,000 to the charity “America’s Mighty Warriors” which helps veterans recover from physical and emotional injuries suffered while in service.

Weidner, who is a veteran himself, says that he was motivated to donate to the charity by the stories of some of the veterans that it has helped. He stated: “I have been so moved by the stories of the veterans America’s Mighty Warriors has helped that I wanted to do something to help them in return. I am proud to be able to contribute to their cause.”

The donation will be used by America’s Mighty Warriors to create a new program called “Heroes Homecoming” which will help house and support wounded veterans and their families while they undergo treatment for their injuries.

Weidner has long been involved in philanthropic work, having previously donated millions of dollars to various charities. In 2011 he gave $10 million to the University of Nevada Las Vegas Foundation for its School of Medicine.

#  Man Who Grew Up in Foster Care Wins $250,000 at Casino

Life has a funny way of giving people second chances. A man who grew up in foster care won $250,000 at a casino, proving that if you work hard enough, anything is possible.

The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, was born into a family that was unable to care for him. He was eventually placed into the foster care system, where he spent most of his childhood.

Now in his thirties, the man has finally hit it big. He was recently playing at a casino when he hit the jackpot on a slot machine, winning $250,000.

"I've never had anything like this happen to me before," he said. "It's a real life-changing experience."

Winning the lottery or hitting a casino jackpot can be a life-changing event, but it's important not to let money go to your head. This man says he plans on using the money to pay off his debts and set himself up for retirement.

He also hopes to use some of the money to help others in need. "I want to help out other kids in foster care," he said. "I know what it's like and I want to help them out any way I can."

This man's story is a reminder that anything is possible if you work hard enough and stay focused on your goals. With determination and perseverance, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.

#  Single Mother Turns to Gambling to Support Her Family and Wins Big

One single mother in the United States has turned to gambling in order to support her family and she has been very successful. <strong>Jessica, who asked that her last name not be used, said she started gambling three years ago after her husband lost his job.</strong> She initially started out betting small amounts of money but eventually began betting larger sums. Earlier this year, Jessica hit the jackpot by winning $125,000 on a slot machine.

"It was just luck," she said of her win. "I never expected to actually win."

While some may view gambling as a risky endeavor, for Jessica it has turned out to be a lifesaver. The extra income has allowed her to pay off some of her debts and put more food on the table. It has also allowed her children to participate in extracurricular activities that they otherwise would not have been able to afford.

"I know it's not a reliable source of income, but it's been a real godsend in my time of need," she said.

While Jessica is grateful for her windfall, she is aware that it could all disappear in an instant. That is why she continues to work two jobs in addition to gambling; she doesn't want to rely on luck alone to support her family.

Despite the risks, many people do gamble with the hope of winning big bucks. In fact, Americans spent nearly $40 billion on casino games last year alone. While only a fraction of those bets resulted in wins like Jessica's, the possibility of becoming a millionaire overnight is certainly an attractive one.

#  Local Veteran Uses Winnings from Casino to Start Nonprofit for Fellow Veterans

Military veterans often have difficulty adjusting to civilian life. For many, finding a job and a place to live is difficult. This is especially true for those who have served in combat zones.

Fortunately, there are programs and nonprofit organizations that exist to help these veterans. One such veteran is Jim Dolan.

Dolan is a military veteran who served in the Vietnam War. After returning home, he found it difficult to adjust to civilian life. He was homeless for a time and struggled with addiction.

However, things changed for Dolan when he won $100,000 from a casino slot machine. He used the money to start a nonprofit organization called Veterans Village Las Vegas. The purpose of the organization is to help homeless veterans find housing and jobs.

So far, Veterans Village Las Vegas has helped over 1,500 veterans get back on their feet. The organization has also provided housing for over 600 veterans.

Dolan is an example of how one person can make a difference in the lives of others. He has shown that even when things are tough, there is always hope.
