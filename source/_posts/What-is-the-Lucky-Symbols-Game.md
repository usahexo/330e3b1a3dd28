# What is the Lucky Symbols Baccarat?

The Lucky Symbols Baccarat is a variant of the traditional baccarat game which is played with six decks of cards. The games uses a different set of symbols to represent the value of cards instead of the numbers used in traditional baccarat.

## How to Play

To begin, each player is dealt two cards. The card values are as follows:

Ace = 1 point
2 = 2 points
3 = 3 points
4 = 4 points
5 = 5 points
6 = 6 points
7 = 7 points
8 = 8 points
9 = 9 points
10 = 10 points

        (J,Q,K)    20 points







 25 points </pre> The goal of the game is to have a point total as close to 9 as possible. If the first two cards dealt total more than 9, then only the last digit is used (e.g., if you are dealt an 8 and a 3, your total would be 5). If one or both players have a point total of 9 or more after the first two cards are dealt, that player wins automatically. If both players have a point total less than 9, then the player with the highest value card wins (e.g., if you are dealt an Ace and a 2, your total would be 3 and your opponent would have a total of 2).If there is still a tie, then it goes to extra cards until there is a winner. ## The Symbols In Lucky Symbols Baccarat, the suits of the playing cards do not matter. Instead, each card has its own symbol which corresponds to its value: club (C), diamond (D), heart (H), spade (S). Therefore, instead of having 12 through 2 as in traditional baccarat, in Lucky Symbols Baccarat you would have C1 through S6. Here are some examples: <pre> Winning Hand: { "type": "winning", "points": 12 } Losing Hand: { "type":"losing", "points": 3 } Tie: { "type":"tie", "points": 0 } </pre>
