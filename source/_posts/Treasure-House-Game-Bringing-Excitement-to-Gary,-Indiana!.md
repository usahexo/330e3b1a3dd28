Gary, Indiana is set to become the newest hot spot for gambling and entertainment as Treasure House Casino prepares to open its doors in late 2019. The casino will operate out of a former manufacturing plant just west of downtown Gary and is expected to create upwards of 1,000 jobs.

The new casino will feature a 140,000-square-foot gaming floor with 2,500 slot machines and 60 table games. In addition, there will be a five-story hotel with 300 rooms, a 10,000-square-foot event center, and several restaurants and bars.
