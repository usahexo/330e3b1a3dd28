#  GAME ROULETTE JUST WHAT TO PLAY: TURKEY EDITION

Turkey is a game that can be best described as the love child of poker and roulette. The game is played with a deck of 52 cards and a special roulette wheel with 36 numbers (0-35). The aim of the game is to bet on the number or range of numbers you think will be randomly chosen by the spinning roulette wheel.

To begin, each player is dealt five cards face down. The player then bets on one of the 36 numbers on the roulette wheel, or a range of numbers (e.g. 1-12). After all players have placed their bets, the dealer flips over the first card in their deck - this is called the 'burn card'. The dealer then spins the roulette wheel and stops it on one of the numbers. If the number called matches your bet, you win! If it doesn't, your bet is lost.

After the spin is complete, the dealer flips over the next card in their deck - this is called the 'turn card'. If this card matches your bet, you win double your stake! For example, if you put £10 on red and it came up as your turn card, you would win £20. If two consecutive cards match your bet (e.g. turn & burn), you win quadruple your stake!

The game continues until all players have either won or lost all their bets. At this point, each player hands in their remaining cards and a new round begins. The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible - at the end of each round, players are awarded points for every winning hand they have (see below for scoring details). The player with the most points at the end of four rounds wins!

If at any stage you run out of money, you are out of the game.

The scoring system for Turkey is as follows:
One point for each Ace 
Two points for each King 
Three points for each Queen 
Four points for each Jack 
Five points for each Ten 
Ten points for each Nine 
Fifteen points for each Eight 
Twenty points for each Seven

#  GAME ROULETTE: HOW TO PLAY

There are various ways to play the game roulette, but the most common is the European or French version. The game is played with a wheel that has 37 numbered slots: 0, 00, and 1-36. Players bet on what number or range of numbers the ball will end up in after the spinning wheel comes to a stop.

To begin playing roulette, you first need to place your bet on the table layout. There are different betting areas depending on which type of roulette you're playing, but the most common bets are inside or outside bets. An inside bet is when you bet on a specific number, and an outside bet is when you bet on a grouping of numbers. After placing your bet, spin the wheel by clicking or tapping on it. When the wheel stops, the ball will fall into one of the numbered slots and your winning or losing bet will be paid according to the odds shown in the payout chart below the table.

If you want to place another bet, simply click or tap on the table again to deselect your current bet and choose a new one. You can also increase or decrease your bet size by using the - and + buttons next to your current bet amount. When you're ready to quit, hit "Clear Bets" to remove all of your bets from the table.

# How to Play Roulette

If you’ve never played roulette before, don’t worry – it’s a really easy game to learn. The basic rules are as follows:

1. Choose a betting table. There will be numbers corresponding to each spot on the wheel, as well as different betting options listed along the edge of the table.

2. Place your bet by placing your chips on the number(s) or betting option(s) that you want to bet on.

3. Spin the wheel by pulling the lever at the side of the table. The ball will be released and will eventually come to rest in one of the numbered slots on the wheel. Your bet will be paid out according to the odds shown on the table.

4. Collect your winnings and start again!

There are a few different types of bets that you can make when playing roulette:

1. Single number bet – You can bet on any one number by placing your chips directly on top of that number on the betting table. This is known as a ‘straight up’ bet and pays out at 35-1 odds if your chosen number comes up.

2. Split bet – If you want to bet on two adjoining numbers, you can place your chips in between those two numbers on the betting table (known as a split). This type of bet pays out at 17-1 odds if either number comes up.

3. Street bet – A street bet is made by placing your chips at either end of a row of three numbers on the betting table (i.e., 1-2-3 or 4-5-6). If one of these numbers comes up, you win 11-1 odds [or 3 times your original stake].
4. Corner bet – A corner bet is made by placing your chips at the intersection of four numbers on the betting table (e.g., 1-2-4-5). This type of bet pays out at 8-1 odds if any one of those numbers comes up.

If the player wins, they get to keep their cards and deal again. If they lose, they must give their cards to the dealer.
