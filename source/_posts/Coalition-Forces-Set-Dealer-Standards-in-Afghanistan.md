#  Coalition Forces Set Dealer Standards in Afghanistan

The international community is rallying behind the Afghan government to provide stability and combat deficits in governance. The effort has been underway for over a decade with various coalition partners rotating through the country. Despite this, corruption remains a major issue and key barrier to development.
Efforts to professionalize the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) have been critical to building partner capacity and enabling better security cooperation between forces. These security sector reforms are also essential for creating an effective and accountable force that can provide necessary public services.
A recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), however, exposes deficiencies in the drug-control efforts of the ANP. The probe found that ANP officers are involved in drug trafficking, receiving bribes from smugglers, and turning a blind eye to poppy cultivation. This comes as no surprise; many Afghans see the police as corrupt and ineffective.

There is a pressing need for coalition partners to work with the Afghan government to establish standards of conduct for all security forces personnel â€” not just the ANA and ANP. This would include measures such as vetting for criminal activity and military discipline, training on human rights and civilian protection, and clear rules of engagement. Only then can Afghanistan be assured of an accountable force that respects human rights and operates within the rule of law, helping to safeguard its nascent democracy.

#  New Dealer Requirements in Place for Afghan Casinos

In September, the Afghan government released a new set of regulations for casinos in the country. The rules, which are aimed at curbing financial crime, require casino operators to obtain licences from the National Directorate of Security (NDS) and to implement anti-money laundering (AML) procedures.

The new regulations build on earlier measures introduced by the Afghan government in 2015, which included a ban on casino advertising and the placement of limits on cash transactions. The aim of the latest rules is to ensure that casinos operate in a responsible and transparent manner, and that they do not facilitate money laundering or other financial crimes.

The NDS has said that it will conduct inspections of casino premises to ensure compliance with the new regulations. Operators who violate the rules could face fines or imprisonment.

Given the security situation in Afghanistan, it is understandable that the Afghan government is seeking to exercise greater control over casinos operations. However, implementing effective AML procedures will be essential if the government is to achieve its objectives.

#  Afghan Casino Dealers Must Meet New Standards

 dealers in Afghan casinos will now be required to meet a new set of standards in order to ensure that they are providing a fair and enjoyable experience to players.

The new regulations, which were drawn up by the Afghanistan Gaming Commission, cover areas such as dress code, responsible gambling, and customer service.

dealers must now wear smart attire, and are not allowed to smoke or drink while they are working. They must also be well-versed in the rules of the games they are dealing, and must be able to answer any questions that players may have.

Players will now also be able to raise any concerns they have about their game directly with the dealer. This is intended to help create a more positive gaming experience for all players.

The aim of the new standards is to create a more professional and regulated gaming industry in Afghanistan. This will not only attract more players to the casinos, but will also help ensure that those players have a safe and enjoyable experience.

#  NATO Rolls Out New Dealer Training Regimen in Afghanistan

NATO has announced a new training program for Afghan security forces intended to better equip them to fight the Taliban and other insurgents. The three-month training regimen, which began in early January, is being conducted at NATO's Regional Training Center in Mazar-e Sharif.

The new program replaces a prior training initiative that was deemed to be ineffective. According to NATO officials, the new regimen will provide Afghan troops with "the skills and knowledge necessary to conduct operations independently and effectively." This will include instruction on areas such as intelligence gathering, logistics, and tactical planning.

In addition, the program will also focus on boosting the morale and cohesiveness of Afghan units. Many of these units have been plagued by low levels of morale and sectarian divisions in recent years. "This is about making sure that we raise the bar, not just on the quality of the troops we are training but also on their willingness and resilience to fight," said Maj. Gen. William Caine, an American officer who is overseeing the program.

The new NATO training regimen has come under criticism from some quarters, with some observers arguing that it is not sufficiently tailored to the specific needs of the Afghan security forces. However, most experts agree that it is a step in the right direction and should help improve Afghan capabilities in combating the Taliban insurgency.
