#  Where is the new Casino EvenBet?

The new Casino EvenBet is being built in the city of Bucharest in Romania. It is a large complex that will include a casino, hotel, spa, and conference center. The developers are expecting it to be a major tourist destination.

The casino is being built on the site of an old steel mill that was demolished in 2016. The construction is expected to be completed in 2020.

The casino will have 350 slot machines and 45 gaming tables. There will also be a VIP lounge for high-rollers. The hotel will have 200 rooms, and the spa will have 10 treatment rooms.

The developers are hoping to attract tourists from all over Europe. They believe that Bucharest offers a lot of attractions that are not available in other European cities. These include the Palace of Parliament, which is the largest building in Europe, and the Stavropoleos Church, which is the oldest church in Bucharest.
